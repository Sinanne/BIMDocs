## **Common BIM Terminology and Glossary**

This glossary provides clear, simple explanations of the most frequently used terms in Building Information Modeling (BIM). It is designed for professionals who may be new to BIM and ISO 19650, helping build a strong foundation for understanding digital construction workflows.

The definitions avoid jargon, focus on clarity, and emphasize how each term fits into practical BIM and ISO 19650 processes.

## **Glossary of Common BIM Terms**

### **BIM (Building Information Modeling)**

A digital, data‑rich process for creating, managing, and sharing information about a built asset throughout its lifecycle.

### **3D Model / BIM Model**

A visual representation of a building that also includes information about materials, dimensions, performance, and relationships between elements.

### **Information Container**

Any structured package of information—models, documents, datasets—managed within a Common Data Environment (CDE).

### **CDE (Common Data Environment)**

A central digital platform used to collect, manage, review, and share project information. It supports approval workflows and version control.

### **ISO 19650**

The international standard that defines *how* information should be managed when using BIM, including naming, responsibilities, workflows, and approvals.

### **LOD (Level of Development)**

Describes how much detail, accuracy, and reliability a model element has. Higher LOD = more certainty.

### **LOI (Level of Information)**

Describes the amount and quality of data attached to a model element (e.g., fire rating, warranty info).

### **Federated Model**

A combined model made by linking together multiple discipline models (architecture, structure, MEP) without merging them.

### **Clash Detection**

The process of identifying conflicts between model elements—such as pipes intersecting beams—before construction.

### **4D BIM**

Adds the time dimension (schedule) to the 3D model, enabling construction sequencing simulations.

### **5D BIM**

Adds cost information to the model for estimating, budgeting, and cost control.

### **7D BIM**

Adds lifecycle and facility management data to support operations and maintenance after handover.

### **IFC (Industry Foundation Classes)**

An open, vendor-neutral data format used to exchange BIM information between different software platforms.

### **openBIM**

A collaborative approach using open standards like IFC to ensure interoperability across tools and stakeholders.

### **Model Authoring Tool**

Software used to create BIM models (e.g., Revit, ArchiCAD, Vectorworks).

### **Information Manager (ISO 19650)**

The role responsible for coordinating information management activities across the project.

### **Task Team / Delivery Team**

Teams responsible for creating and delivering project information, such as architects, engineers, and contractors.

### **EIR / AIR / OIR**

**Employer’s Information Requirements (EIR):** What information the client needs for the project.  
**Asset Information Requirements (AIR):** Information needed to operate the asset.  
**Organizational Information Requirements (OIR):** Information needed at the organizational level for decision-making.

### **BEP (BIM Execution Plan)**

A plan that defines how BIM will be carried out on a project, including roles, processes, standards, and deliverables.

### **COBie (Construction-Operations Building Information Exchange)**

A standardized format for delivering asset data to facility managers.

### **Data Drop**

A scheduled release of information at specific stages (aligned with ISO 19650 workflow gates).

### **Revision / Version Control**

Processes that ensure all project participants work with the latest, approved information.

### Practical Example

A hospital renovation project uses BIM to streamline design and construction.

*   The architect creates the **architectural model** (LOD 200).
*   The engineer adds structural elements and updates **LOI** with material properties.
*   All models are linked into a **federated model** for coordination.
*   The contractor uses the CDE to submit updates, following **revision control** and ISO 19650 workflows.
*   Clash detection ensures ducts and beams don’t collide.
*   At handover, equipment data is provided in **COBie** format for the facility manager.

This example demonstrates how core BIM terminology appears naturally in real project workflows.

### Common Pitfalls

1.  **Confusing LOD and LOI**
    *   *LOD is geometry; LOI is data. Treat them separately.*

2.  **Assuming a “BIM Model” is just a 3D drawing**
    *   *A BIM model contains relationships, metadata, and structured information.*

3.  **Misunderstanding the CDE**
    *   *The CDE is not just cloud storage—it includes workflow, approval, and version control.*

4.  **Using terms inconsistently across teams**
    *   *Adopt a shared project glossary aligned with standards like ISO 19650.*

5.  **Ignoring the difference between a coordinated model and a federated model**
    *   *Federated means linked, not merged.*
